#In this project, I am querying a database with 11 tables including employees, customers, invoices, playlists, tracks, and more.

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = "Brazil"
ORDER BY LastName asc;

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, invoices.InvoiceId, invoices.InvoiceDate, invoices.BillingCountry

WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent";

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, inv.InvoiceId

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)

SELECT track.name, inv.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks track
JOIN chinook.invoice_items inv

#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

ON cust.CustomerId=inv.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
