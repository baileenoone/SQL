# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

#What is the average danceability by artist and track?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

#Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10 

#What artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms desc
LIMIT 1

#What is the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?

SELECT artist_name, popularity, AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10 

#Which tracks have a popularity score of 90 or higher?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity > 90
ORDER BY popularity desc

#What is the highest valence score in the table?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, valence
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY valence desc
LIMIT 1

#Which tracks have a key value of 11?

SELECT track_name, artist_name, song_key
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE song_key=11
ORDER BY track_name asc

#What is the average duration of all tracks in the table?

SELECT AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

#What is the total number of tracks for each artist in descending order?

SELECT artist_name, COUNT(*) as tracks
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY tracks desc

#Which artists have the top 3 highest energy scores and danceability scores?

SELECT artist_name, energy, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy desc, danceability desc
LIMIT 3
